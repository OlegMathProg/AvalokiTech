# It is a lightweight 2D game engine in progress(written on Object Pascal and compilled in Lazarus). 
# Uses software rendering. 
# Of the features, I can note the super high performance of splines and sprites(work is still being done on it). 
# In the future, a powerful editor for sprites, splines and other game objects will be available.
# Executable file is included, so run-n-fun ðŸ˜‰.
